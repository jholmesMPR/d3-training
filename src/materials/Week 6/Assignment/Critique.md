# Critque

## Pros

* The toggles make it easy to graph four different variables at any point. 
* Seems like a potentially useful tool for exploratory data analysis.
* It's great that the labels have a pop-up to tell the user more about the metric. 

## Cons

* Not immediately clear how the size of the dot is connected to each country, guessing it's population
* The large-year changing in the background takes away from, rather than adding to the image. Time is already displayed below the x-axis, so it seems extraneous to have it in the background as well. 
* The ability to graph four variables, which sometime useful, can also take away from the image, which it seems to do here in some cases. It isn't immediately obvious how the color and size of the points map to different variables. 
* I don't like how when income is on the x-axis the metrics chagne from 1000s to k (should be consistent)
* A point that changes size also becomes a circle, which isn't the best way to display data because it's hard to compare.

## Change 
* The data to ink-ratio seems large here. I would potentially try to simplify some of the graphs or toggles.
* I would group the size and color toggles together and make it very clear what they are presenting.
