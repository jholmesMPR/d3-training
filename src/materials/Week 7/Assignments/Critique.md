## Critique

### Pros

* Gives a good visual depiction of the concentration of monuments in NYC, monuments in the area maybe?
* The color theme of the background map is good. The whole map doesn't overwhelm the user with color. 

### Cons
* Unclear what the values, and thereby color is supposed to represnt
* Could have been better to have a log scale, since the average is so low
* Visually the circle isn't the best metric to indicate a value and since they're using a discrete color scale to indicate value it could be improved by using 5 different colors, all the same size
* Half the page, he background map and visuals on the New Jersey side,  is essentially unused/unnecessary in the visual, t

### Improvements

* Simplify the map to focus entirely on NYC and the surrounding burroughs
* Simplify the background map
* Use color, but fill in the map as a colorpleth instead of using circles to indicate values
* This would also give the user a better sense of number of monuments to square area of the parks, while right now the large circles cover up some of the smaller parks entirely
