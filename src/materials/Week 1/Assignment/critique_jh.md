####Viz 1


Pros

* Colors work well together, aesthetically pleasing
* X-axis labels and title are clearly labeled

Cons

* Hard to gather immediately what the graphic is trying to display; although it's trying to compare sales stategies it isn't immediate which strategy is the most successful or least successful
* The two y-axes are confusing, isn't immediately clear that the left-axis appears to represent the bars and the right-axis appears to reflect overall totals
* Not super-clear if the total amount is the sum of all the product values
* Y-axis labels aren't very clear, could be "Product Profit" or "Product Quantity" on the left-axis, and "Total Amount" on the right-axis


Improvements:

* Make legend more compact
* Organize by product instead of by strategy, hard to compare the products as it's organized right now
* Make an 'Overall' part of the graph to compare strategies overall to subsitute for the double x-axis
* Clarify axis labels

I think my graph is more effective at presenting the data because the elements have been reorganized. The "same" data are shown, but the graph displays these data in two graphs rather than one.

####Viz 2
Pros

* Axis labels are clear and simple
* The consistency of colors across the different medicine categories makes it easy to compare across categories

Cons

* Unclear what the red boxes and blue boxes are at the bottom and top of each bar
* Too many categories/colors make it difficult to tell which color is associated with which category
* The percents to the right of each bar don't add up to 1 or 100, so it's confusing as to what metric is trying to be communicated

Improvements:

* Simplify amount of information being shown in graph
* Decrease the number of overall colors/categories

I think this graph is far more effective than the first graph. Although, not all the data are shown, some have been grouped into an 'other' section, the graph is much easier to read and compare categories. The legend has also been made simpler and more concise.

####Viz 3

Pros

* Colors go nicely together in the center graphic
* The content being communicated works well together across different graphs

Cons

* Title could be clearer as most of the graphs are related to consumer spending of Halloween products
* In the **Annual Spending on Halloween** it's unclear what metric pumpkin size is associated with, looks like it might be spending
* Unclear how the size of the circles in the **Average Spending per Person by Item** second is related to spending 
* In the **Average Spending per Person be Item** section *Greeting cards* is missing a dollar metric and because the circle size isn't clearly related to spending it's really hard to guess at what metric for *Greeting cards* might be
* The extra graphic art, also cute, doesn't add to the information being communicated and leads to a more cluttered infographic
* Although the content being communicated works well together, the layout of the infographic could be improved to lead to reader through the different metrics

Improvements:

* Make the infographic more linear and have more flow
* Simplify color palette
* Use bars instead of circles to show metrics that are easily comparable

The new infographic more effectively displays the data by organizing the data in such a way that it's easy to follow. The new graphic also uses bars instead of circles to compare metrics, allowing the the user to more quickly and easily compare across year or categories.
