# Write-Up


## Goals
The goals of the tool to explore how the employee make-up of Mathematica and how it has changed over the years. The intended audience is Mathematica employees.


## Type
I choose to make an exploratory tool with a little bit of narration (to make it fun). The interactivity of the networks allow the user to explore the structure of different divisions in Mathematica. I thought this could potentially be useful in the future with the addition of some background of different people in the network. For example, if a project is looking for a statistician and they've worked with a particular statistician before, they could search for similar statisticians by group. 

## Features

The networks were the visualization that I was able to spend the most time on, so it definitely is the most exploratory visualization. The stacked bar chart also allows the user to see how different divisions have grown in different years.
