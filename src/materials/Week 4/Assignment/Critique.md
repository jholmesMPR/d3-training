# Critique

## Pros

* Colors are indicative of what American's associate with Democratic/Republican party colors
* Legend also makes clear which color is associated with which party

## Cons

* Very unclear what the bars actually represent, percents, counts, amount of time talking about, etc.
* The lack of consistent placement of the bar labels make it challenging to read
* It's a little unclear why the bars are going in opposite directions, how does this add to the visualization, instead of placing the bars side by side
* The bars going in opposite directions also make it more challenging to compare the length of the bars, without the text the user has to work harder
* The data-ink ratio could be better, seems like a lot of color and labels that are unnecessary
* No labels on anything
* Color doesn't actually add anything because the bars are going in opposite directions



## Improvements

* Labels and titles to clarify what the data are showing
* Comparing bars side-by-side
* Potentially a comparison group from a different year that shows how topic ownership has changed or shifted from one year to another
* Potentially a drop-down menu for the user to select which topic they wish to compare between Democrats and Republicans to keep the ink-to-data ratio more manageable
* Grid lines instead of spelling out each topic frequency exactly to cut down on the ink-data ratio again
