# Critique

## Pros

* Well labeled 
* A lot of information is presented in a fairly straight forward manner
* The text across the timeline adds nice context to the graph, leads the viewer through a story, rather than just presenting the information

## Cons

* The coalition deaths could be a slightly darker color, missed them on the first past through
* The main graph could be a little bit smaller, overwhelms the other graphs
* The rounded edges of the bars on the main graph resemble blood, which is a little bit distracting to the user
* It's a little bit unclear why the circles in the 'Biggest Killers' are overlapping
* Quite a few circle graphics, which are hard to compare

## Improvements

* I would place the text about the United States exiting the Iraq war at the top underneath the title. Right now it's placement feels a little bit random.
* I would organize the charts in a slightly different way such that the visual leads the user through its story in a clear manner
* I would link the main graphic with the graphics in gray, such that when a user scrolled over the main graphic, the gray graphics changed colors to show the data associated with that particular date.
* I would get rid of all of the circle graphics and replace them with bars
