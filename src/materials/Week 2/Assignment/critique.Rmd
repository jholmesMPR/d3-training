## Vis 1

Pros

* Good overall flow/layout to the dashboard, i.e. all of the monthly graphs are grouped together and all of the quarterly graphs are grouped together
* Color of the quarterly performance graphs shows the difference between what the organizations has designated good, okay, and bad performance

Cons

* Pie charts, this data could be displayed linearly
* The sales pipeline data are displayed as two tables, could be displayed as a barchart instead
* The points on the monthly performance (x) are a little bit distracting, could be better to use a simple dot, and the color is also unnecessary
* It looks like the quarterly and monthly performance categories show the same metrics, just summarized by quarter or by month. In that case the graphs should probably be the same.

Improvements

* The overall image is simplified
* The dashboard is unified under one color-theme
* The dashboard has been simplifed by creating widgets to the left of the the graphs
* All the products and regions are shown in the same graph for easy comparison
* Pie charts are turned into line charts for easy comparison of categories

## Vis 2

Pros

* The sidebar makes it easy to select a product to look at different sales metrics 

Cons

* Because the sidebar is laided out by product, it makes it challenging to compare across product groups, if comparing across product groups is a goal of the organization, then this isn't the most effective tool
* Colors are not consistent across all graphs (no unified color theme)
* Colors are most likely not color-blind accessible (red + green in same chart)
* The colors from 'row 1' and 'row 6' are too similar to be easily and quickly distinguishable
* Column x and row x are not descriptive category names
* The same pie chart is displayed twice (are the sales and margin really the same?)
* The units on the y-axis should be in 1000s or 10000s not millions to avoid 0.00002
* In the lower-right graph there are both solid and dashed lines and it's unclear if they are supposed to distinguish between additional categories
* The upper-middle graph has a combination of line, bar, and area making for a very confusing graph

Improvements
* Didn't have time to complete actual mock-up

## Vis 3

Pros

* The blues spectrum and blacks spectrum are appropriate as the metric they're trying to display is continuous
* The individual percentages displayed are a useful addition to the visualization
* Bars a good choice for displaying the data

Cons

* The visualization is overall a little too busy, it takes the user a little to long to figure out what is being displayed
* The background football field, while on theme, adds to the business of the visual 
* The visual only compares the New Orleans Saints with the platform average, could be useful to make a drop-down to select other teams to compare as well
* The white text on white-gray background is hard to read 
* There isn't really a good reason to have two different color themes for the Saints vs. Platform average, as the spectrums are showing the same data

Improvements

* My visualization improves on the initial visual by making it less 'busy'
* The season and team choice are simplified as a widget to the side of the graph instead of displaying all the data at once
* The color spectrum is also simplified, so that there aren't two spectrums representing the same categories
