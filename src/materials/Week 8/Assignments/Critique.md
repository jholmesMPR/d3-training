# Critique

### Pros
* The pop-ups provide informative information, but that information is hard to read
* The color palette is nice, however the text on the background color should be white or a light color and not black, making it easier to read. 

### Cons

* Although the visualization offers a guide to read chord diagrams, I don't think they're the best way to present the data. The linear version of the chord diagram presents the data to the user, but it isn't circular, making it easier to interpret. 
* Not immediately clear how the two diagrams differ
* Difficult to use interactions
* The total migrating population is rendered twice in the background of each chord diagram, making it both difficult to read and also redundant
* The transition between years, although it looks kind of interesting, provides the user with no information and contributes to the overall 'messy' feeling of this visualization
* It's unclear if there are buttons at the top, and if they aren't buttons, then it seems unnecessary


### Improvements

* Use the linear version of a chord diagram
* Utilize the free space to the right of the diagrams to present additional information when a user hovers or clicks
* Make the diagram titles clearer
* Lighter colors for the titles and other labels on the dark background
* Keep the total migration summation, but shift that summation to the right as well, and only render it once
* Make the buttons on the top more function or omit them altogether
