### Viz Critique

Pros:

* Ink to paper ratio is good
* Scale of both y-axes seems appropriate
* The grid lines are nice guides to add to the visual

Cons: 

* The points and metrics overlap in a few areas, making it challenging to read the metrics for *number of orders*
* This is a preference, but I would probably center the title
* Could take out the 2014 in the x-axis labels, since all of the points are from 2014. I would instead add that to the title, such that the title would read 'Number of Orders and Amount of Sales (2014)'.
* The legend could be a little bit more descriptive 
* The bars stand out to me first rather than the sales, although the person looking at this metric could potentially be more interested in total sales, rather than number of orders.
* I'm not sure the metrics on the top of each bar are completely necessary, that work is already being accomplished by the gridlines.
* The dual axis is perhaps a bit problematic. There looks like there's a large drop in sales in September, but in reality September is probably on 40K lower than average. This comes from the right-hand y-axis starting at 100k instead of 0.
